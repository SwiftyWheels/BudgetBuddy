# Budget Buddy

Buddy Budget generates a simple budget for you based on your income and expenses. It is a simple web

be a good starting point for someone who wants to get a handle on their finances.

## How to use

1. Enter your income and expenses in the form.
2. Enter percentages for savings and debt repayment.
3. Click "Generate Budget".
4. Review the budget and make any changes you want.
